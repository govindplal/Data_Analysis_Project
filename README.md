The project is done on Jupyter Notebook using Python.  
The libraries used are :  
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikitlearn  

The aims of the project were:
* Obtaining a statistical summary of the dataframe
* Replacing the missing values in the dataset with the mean values
* Comparing the outliers in the sales of houses with and without waterfont view
* Finding the correlation of certain feature with the price of the house
* Creating linear regression models to predict price using different features and finding the coefficient of determination
* Splitting the dataset into test samples and training samples.
* Creating ridge regression object using the test data and training data and finding the coefficient of determination, thus, evaluating the model and refining it if required.
